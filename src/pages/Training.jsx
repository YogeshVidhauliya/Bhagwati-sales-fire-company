        <h2> Fire Extinguisher Training</h2>

        <p className="about-para">
          A strong emergency response plan starts with proper fire safety training.
          Even the best fire extinguishers and equipment are of little use if employees
          don’t know how to operate them effectively during an emergency.

          At <b>Bhagwati Fire Safety</b>, we provide comprehensive Fire Extinguisher Training —
          both in the classroom and through live fire demonstrations. Participants use real
          fire extinguishers to control an actual fire, giving them realistic, hands-on
          experience that builds confidence and quick response capability in real-life situations.
